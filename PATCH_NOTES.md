# Patch notes / how to apply

This zip contains only the files that changed for the “next big slice” update:

- ship design + component library (data-driven)
- research UI + research progression
- jump points + multi-system travel
- basic combat (auto-fire + attack orders)
- fix for `ImGui_ImplSDLRenderer2_RenderDrawData` signature mismatch

## Apply locally

1. Unzip `nebula4x_patch_pack.zip`.
2. Copy the extracted folders into your repository root (overwrite when prompted).
3. Build.

## Apply via GitHub web UI

GitHub will **not** auto-extract a zip you upload.

1. Unzip `nebula4x_patch_pack.zip` on your machine.
2. In your repo on GitHub: **Add file → Upload files**.
3. Drag & drop the extracted folders/files into the upload area (keep the same folder structure).
4. Commit.
