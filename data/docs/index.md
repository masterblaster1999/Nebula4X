# Nebula4X Codex

Welcome to the in-game Codex.

The Codex is an offline help browser (ships with the build) that lives inside **Help / Codex** (default: **F1**).

## Start here

- [Getting Started](getting_started.md)
- [UI Tour](ui_tour.md)
- [Guided Tours](tours.md)
- [Hotkeys & Shortcuts](hotkeys.md)
- [Automation & Profiles](automation.md)
- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)

## Power user tips

- [Command Console](command_console.md): default **Ctrl+P** (configurable in Settings → Hotkeys).
- [Notification Center](notifications.md): default **F3** (configurable in Settings → Hotkeys).
- [Intel Notebook](intel_notebook.md): system notes + curated journal. Default **Ctrl+Shift+I**.
- [OmniSearch](omnisearch.md): default **Ctrl+F** (configurable in Settings → Hotkeys).
- [Compare / Diff](compare.md): compare two entities + export a merge patch. Default **Ctrl+Shift+X**.
- **Docking:** drag window tabs to rearrange your workspace. Save it with **Layout Profiles** (default: **Ctrl+Shift+L**).

## About these docs

This is a living set of notes intended to make the current UI approachable while the simulation grows.
If a feature behaves differently than described here, treat the UI as the source of truth and use the
Command Console / OmniSearch to inspect what the simulation state is doing.
