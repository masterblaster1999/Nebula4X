Nebula4X Patch Apply Notes (Round 2+)

This patch ZIP is meant to be extracted into the *repo root*:
  - the folder that contains:  CMakeLists.txt,  src/,  include/,  data/

Common gotcha on Windows:
If you extracted the original repo ZIP into a folder called 'Nebula4X-main', you may end up with:

  ...\Nebula4X-main\Nebula4X-main\src\...

In that case, the repo root is the *inner* 'Nebula4X-main' directory.
Extract this patch ZIP into that inner folder so that paths like:

  src\ui\sustainment_window.cpp

overwrite the existing file in the build.

(If you see a new 'src' folder created next to an inner 'Nebula4X-main' folder,
you extracted into the wrong directory level.)
